What Children’s Data We Collect
We don’t knowingly collect data from or about children without the permission of their parent or guardian. When we do collect that data, we might do it directly, like when you sign up for a service. We might also collect it automatically if your child uses the products or services we offer. We collect the following data:
- Geolocation Data – we collect data that tells us the location of your child’s smart device.
- Unique Identifiers – we collect device and network identifiers - basically, ways for us to tell which smart device on our network is your child’s.
- Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) generated by your child’s use of our wireless voice communications services.
- Information from your child’s use of our products, services, and network (and other carriers’ networks when roaming domestically or internationally) like usage of connecting carriers and Internet service providers, the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, text messages, and data use history, content interactions (e.g., how long you use an app), language settings, and other network and device analytics and Wi-Fi connection and usage data.
- Device and service performance and diagnostic information – this includes reports from your child’s device about signal strength, speeds, app and service performance, dropped calls, call and data failures, geolocation information, and device data.

How We Use Children’s Data
The main reason we collect children’s data is to provide the product or service that collected the data. But we may also use children’s data to do things like:

When We Share Children’s Data
Sometimes we hire others to help us provide a product or service, and these service providers may need access to children’s data. They are required to keep children’s data we provide them confidential and to use it only to provide the services we requested. We may also share children’s data with third parties, including the government, for legal processes or to protect life and safety where we believe that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the data is reasonably necessary.

We know it’s important to treat data you tell us is from children under 18 carefully. This Notice explains what we do (and don’t do) when it comes to children’s data.

What Children’s Data We Collect
We don’t knowingly collect data from or about children without the permission of their parent or guardian. When we do collect that data, we might do it directly, like when you sign up for a service. We might also collect it automatically if your child uses the products or services we offer. We collect the following data:
- Geolocation Data – we collect data that tells us the location of your child’s smart device.
- Unique Identifiers – we collect device and network identifiers - basically, ways for us to tell which smart device on our network is your child’s.
- Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) generated by your child’s use of our wireless voice communications services.
- Information from your child’s use of our products, services, and network (and other carriers’ networks when roaming domestically or internationally) like usage of connecting carriers and Internet service providers, the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, text messages, and data use history, content interactions (e.g., how long you use an app), language settings, and other network and device analytics and Wi-Fi connection and usage data.

When We Share Children’s Data
Sometimes we hire others to help us provide a product or service, and these service providers may need access to children’s data. They are required to keep children’s data we provide them confidential and to use it only to provide the services we requested. We may also share children’s data with third parties, including the government, for legal processes or to protect life and safety where we believe that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the data is reasonably necessary.

We know it’s important to treat data you tell us is from children under 18 carefully. This Notice explains what we do (and don’t do) when it comes to children’s data.

What Children’s Data We Collect
We don’t knowingly collect data from or about children without the permission of their parent or guardian. When we do collect that data, we might do it directly, like when you sign up for a service. We might also collect it automatically if your child uses the products or services we offer. We collect the following data:

They are required to keep children’s data we provide them confidential and to use it only to provide the services we requested. We may also share children’s data with third parties, including the government, for legal processes or to protect life and safety where we believe that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the data is reasonably necessary.

We know it’s important to treat data you tell us is from children under 18 carefully. This Notice explains what we do (and don’t do) when it comes to children’s data.

What Children’s Data We Collect
We don’t knowingly collect data from or about children without the permission of their parent or guardian. When we do collect that data, we might do it directly, like when you sign up for a service. We might also collect it automatically if your child uses the products or services we offer. We collect the following data:
- Geolocation Data – we collect data that tells us the location of your child’s smart device.
- Unique Identifiers – we collect device and network identifiers - basically, ways for us to tell which smart device on our network is your child’s.
- Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) generated by your child’s use of our wireless voice communications services.
- Information from your child’s use of our products, services, and network (and other carriers’ networks when roaming domestically or internationally) like usage of connecting carriers and Internet service providers, the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, text messages, and data use history, content interactions (e.g., how long you use an app), language settings, and other network and device analytics and Wi-Fi connection and usage data.
- Device and service performance and diagnostic information – this includes reports from your child’s device about signal strength, speeds, app and service performance, dropped calls, call and data failures, geolocation information, and device data.

When We Share Children’s Data
Sometimes we hire others to help us provide a product or service, and these service providers may need access to children’s data. They are required to keep children’s data we provide them confidential and to use it only to provide the services we requested. We may also share children’s data with third parties, including the government, for legal processes or to protect life and safety where we believe that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the data is reasonably necessary.
